1. good code is readble and scalable

2.use performance.now for knowing how much time it takes to complete a prompt , console.log(performance.now());

3. O(n) or linear = a run time is how much time it takes to complete , it depend on number of inputs

4. time complextity = time required by algorithm to solve given problem

5. space complexty = amount of memory an algo uses based on input size

6. 0(1) = constant time ,
   fucntion(boxes){
   clg(boxes[0])
   }

7) 0(1) space = constant space or in place
8) there are certain rules in big o notation
